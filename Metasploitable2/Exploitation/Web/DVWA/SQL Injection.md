# SQL Injection – DVWA (Metasploitable2)

## Overview

During the web application exploitation phase of the penetration test, a SQL
Injection vulnerability was identified in the Damn Vulnerable Web Application
(DVWA) hosted on Metasploitable2. Improper input validation allowed manipulation
of backend SQL queries, resulting in unauthorized access to sensitive data.

## Affected Component

- Application: Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)

- Vulnerable Module: SQL Injection

- HTTP Method: GET

- Parameter: `id`

- Endpoint: `/dvwa/vulnerabilities/sqli/`

## Vulnerability Details

The application directly embeds user-supplied input into SQL queries without
sanitization or parameterization. By injecting SQL control logic, an attacker
can alter the intended query behavior.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)

## Payload Used

`1' OR '1'='1' -- -`

## Request

`http://<TARGET-IP>/dvwa/vulnerabilities/sqli/?id=1' OR '1'='1' -- -&Submit=Submit`

## Observed Result

- First name: `admin`
- Surname: `admin`

The application returned administrative user information without proper
authorization, confirming successful SQL injection.

## Impact

- Unauthorized disclosure of user information

- Potential extraction of credentials and database contents

- Increased attack surface for further exploitation

## Severity

High

## Root Cause

The backend SQL query concatenates user input directly into the query string,
making it vulnerable to injection attacks.

## Mitigation Recommendations

- Implement prepared statements and parameterized queries

- Validate and sanitize all user input

- Enforce least-privilege access for database accounts

- Disable detailed SQL error messages in production environments
